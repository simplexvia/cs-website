## Introduction
Reining competitions showcase the horse's athleticism through precise maneuvers like circles, spins, sliding stops, rollbacks, and lead changes. Governed primarily by the National Reining Horse Association (NRHA) for professional-level events and the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) for breed-specific shows, reining tests willing guidance and control. Events range from local classes to high-stakes futurities and world championships.

## Divisions and Eligibility
Reining divisions vary by governing body. AQHA uses Open, Amateur (including Select for 50+), and Youth, with Levels (1 novice, 2 intermediate, 3 advanced) based on points/earnings. NRHA focuses on rider/horse lifetime earnings for classes like Open, Non-Pro, and novice levels.

| Division                  | Eligibility/Qualifications                                                                 | Potential Winnings (per Class/Event) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Open**                  | Open to professionals and all riders (AQHA/NRHA membership required). No earnings caps in top levels; leveled by horse points in AQHA. | Local: $200–$2,000+. Majors/Futurities: $10,000–$200,000+ (e.g., NRHA Futurity champions). |
| **Intermediate/Limited Open** | Earnings caps (e.g., NRHA ≤ certain lifetime amounts); AQHA Level 2 based on points.      | Modest at locals; solid shares in aged events. |
| **Non-Pro/Amateur**       | Non-professional status (no training remuneration); earnings caps for lower levels. Select Amateur (50+). | Local: $100–$1,500. Majors: $5,000–$100,000+ in Non-Pro futurities. |
| **Prime Time/Intermediate Non-Pro** | Age 50+ or mid-level earnings in NRHA.                                                     | Comparable to Non-Pro; good payouts in larger shows. |
| **Novice/Rookie/Level 1** | Low lifetime earnings/points; beginner-friendly (AQHA Rookie ≤ limited points).            | Primarily prizes; modest jackpots to preserve eligibility. |
| **Youth** (13 & Under / 14-18) | Riders 18 & under; splits by age. Youth membership required.                               | Mostly prizes (buckles, saddles); small cash in some events. |

## Costs and Potential Winnings
Local AQHA/NRHA shows: $200–$600 entry (per class or slate). Majors/futurities: $1,000–$5,000+ nomination/entry fees. Local winnings: $100–$2,000 + prizes; major events like NRHA Futurity/Derby offer $500,000–$1M+ purses, with champions earning $50,000–$200,000+.
