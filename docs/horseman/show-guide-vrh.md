## Introduction
Versatility Ranch Horse (VRH) competitions, primarily governed by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), showcase the all-around abilities of working ranch horses through six classes: ranch riding, ranch trail, ranch reining, ranch cow work, ranch cutting, and ranch conformation. These events emphasize practical ranch skills and are accessible to various rider levels, from beginners to professionals. Competitions are held at local, regional, and national levels, with opportunities for qualification to world championships.

## Divisions and Eligibility
AQHA VRH divisions cater to different rider experiences and statuses. Open divisions may split by horse age (Junior: 5 and under; Senior: 6+). Limited and Rookie options provide modified rules for beginners, such as boxing-only cow work.

| Division                  | Eligibility/Qualifications                                                                 | Potential Winnings (per Class/All-Around) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Open** (may include Junior/Senior horse splits) | Open to all riders, including professionals/trainers. No restrictions on experience or earnings. Typically for experienced competitors. | Local/Regional: $100–$1,000+ cash if placing high (jackpot from entries + possible added money); prizes like buckles/saddles. World: Higher share of total purse (~$475,000+ across all); top all-around potentially $5,000–$20,000+ cash/prizes. |
| **Cowboy**                | For full-time working ranch cowboys employed by a working cattle ranch (minimum 90 days prior to show). No professional trainer status. | Similar to Open; often comparable or slightly lower purses in some shows. Focus on prestige + modest cash/prizes at locals; shares in World purse. |
| **Amateur**               | Must hold AQHA amateur card (non-professional; no remuneration for training/riding). No point/earnings caps. For experienced amateurs. | Local: $100–$800 cash + prizes. World: Significant cash for top placers; similar distribution to Open. |
| **Limited Amateur**       | Must hold AQHA amateur card. No restrictions on points or earnings for horse or rider. Standalone classes allowed; for amateurs stepping up but not yet elite. | Slightly lower than full Amateur in some locals (smaller fields); good cash potential at regionals/World. |
| **Rookie Amateur**        | Must hold AQHA amateur card. Exhibitor must have ≤10 lifetime points in any breed association (including AQHA VRH All-Around) OR ≤$500 earnings in national organizations (e.g., NCHA, NRCHA) in specified western performance disciplines. Beginner-friendly with modified rules (e.g., boxing only in cow work, no dragging logs in trail). | Primarily prizes/ribbons (buckles, gear); limited or no cash at many shows to maintain rookie status. Modest jackpots possible. |
| **Youth**                 | Riders 18 & under (as of January 1). Must hold AQHA youth membership. For experienced youth. | Mostly non-cash: buckles, saddles, ribbons. Some locals offer small cash; World shares prizes from overall purse. |
| **Limited Youth**         | Riders 18 & under. Must hold AQHA youth membership. No point/earnings caps. For youth progressing in skills. | Similar to Youth; prizes-focused with potential small cash in larger events. |
| **Rookie Youth**          | Riders 18 & under. Same point/earnings limits as Rookie Amateur. Modified rules for beginners. | Prizes/ribbons only; no or minimal cash to preserve eligibility. |

## Costs and Potential Winnings

Winnings at locals are modest ($100–$1,000 + prizes); world-level offers $475,000+ total purse, with top all-around winners potentially earning $5,000–$20,000+.
