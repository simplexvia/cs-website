## Introduction
Reined Cow Horse events, governed by the National Reined Cow Horse Association (NRCHA), combine reining maneuvers with cow work, emphasizing vaquero traditions. Competitions typically include 2-3 phases: rein work, cow work (boxing, fence turns, circling), and herd work in major events. Divisions range from open to youth, with aged horse events like futurities.

## Divisions and Eligibility
NRCHA divisions are based on rider earnings and experience, with concurrent levels. Aged events for horses 3-6 years old.

| Division                  | Eligibility/Qualifications                                                                 | Potential Winnings (per Class/All-Around or Event) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Open** (e.g., Open Bridle, Open Hackamore, Open Two-Rein) | Open to any rider with NRCHA membership. No earnings restrictions; for professionals and top competitors. | Local/Regional: $500–$5,000+ if placing high (jackpot + added money). Major Events (e.g., Derby, Celebration of Champions): High share of large purses; top placers $10,000–$100,000+ in aged events like Snaffle Bit Futurity/Derby. |
| **Intermediate Open**     | Open riders not in Top 30/20 based on recent Open earnings. Runs concurrent with Open.     | Similar to Open but smaller fields/purses in some events; good cash in majors. |
| **Limited Open / Level 1 Open** | Lifetime earnings ≤$15,000–$20,000 in Open/Non-Pro NRCHA events. Beginner pro level.       | Modest at locals ($200–$2,000); solid in aged events with added money. |
| **Non-Pro** (e.g., Non-Pro Bridle, Non-Pro Hackamore) | Must hold NRCHA Non-Pro card (no remuneration for training/riding; ownership rules apply). No earnings caps for full Non-Pro. | Local: $300–$3,000 + prizes. Majors: Significant; $5,000–$50,000+ for top in Derby/Futurity Non-Pro. |
| **Intermediate Non-Pro**  | Non-Pro card; not in top rankings (e.g., Top 25) based on recent earnings.                 | Comparable to Non-Pro; strong payouts in larger shows. |
| **Limited Non-Pro / Level 1 Non-Pro** | Non-Pro card; lifetime earnings caps (e.g., ≤$15,000–$100,000 depending on level). Stepping stone for amateurs. | Lower than full Non-Pro; focus on progression with modest cash/prizes at locals, better in majors. |
| **Non-Pro Boxing** (includes Select, Limited, Intermediate) | Non-Pro eligible; often ≤$750–$1,000 fence work earnings. Cow work limited to boxing (no full fence). Beginner-friendly. | Primarily prizes (buckles, gear); limited cash jackpots. Some added in majors. |
| **Youth** (e.g., Youth Bridle, Youth Boxing, Youth Limited) | Riders 18 & under (some splits 13 & under). May include boxing-only options.                | Mostly non-cash: buckles, saddles, ribbons. Small cash possible in larger events; shares in youth-specific purses. |
| **Cowboy**                | Working ranch cowboys employed in livestock operations; ≤$15,000 NRCHA earnings outside Cowboy Class. | Modest cash + prizes; emphasis on prestige and year-end awards. |

## Costs and Potential Winnings
Local shows: $400–$1,000+ entry (cattle fees included). Majors add entry deadlines/fees. Winnings at locals: $200–$5,000; majors like Futurity: $100,000+ added, with top earnings $50,000–$200,000+.
