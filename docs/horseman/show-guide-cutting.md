## Introduction
Cutting Horse competitions, under the National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA), involve separating a cow from the herd and demonstrating control without reins. Judged on a 70-point base, focusing on herd work, cow control, and difficulty. No set patterns; freestyle with judging criteria.

## Divisions and Eligibility
NCHA divisions by rider status and horse age for Limited Age Events (LAE). Youth splits by age.

| Division                  | Eligibility/Qualifications                                                                 | Potential Winnings (per Class/Event) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Open** (includes LAE like Futurity, Derby, Classic) | Open to any NCHA member/rider, including professionals/trainers. No earnings restrictions; for elite competitors. Horses in LAE must be eligible by age (e.g., 3-year-olds for Futurity). | Local/Weekend: $500–$5,000+ (jackpot + added up to $3,000). Majors (e.g., Futurity): $100,000–$500,000+ for top placers (e.g., over $1M total purse in Super Stakes Open). |
| **Non-Pro** (includes LAE) | NCHA Non-Pro certification required (no remuneration for training/riding; stricter rules than Amateur). No earnings caps. Horses in LAE by age. | Local: $300–$3,000 + prizes. Majors: $50,000–$200,000+ for winners (e.g., Non-Pro Futurity shares in $300,000+ purses). |
| **Amateur** (includes LAE; subset of Non-Pro) | NCHA Amateur certification (Non-Pro rules + no judging/compensation for horse shows; ownership proof required). Riders 19+; no earnings caps. Horses in LAE by age. | Similar to Non-Pro but often slightly lower fields; $200–$2,500 local, $20,000–$100,000+ in majors like Amateur Derby. |
| **Limited Non-Pro** (Level 1/2; includes LAE) | Non-Pro certification; lifetime earnings caps (e.g., ≤$35,000 for Level 1, ≤$100,000 for Level 2 in NCHA events). Stepping stone for progressing amateurs. | Modest: $100–$1,500 local jackpots; smaller shares in LAE majors ($5,000–$50,000 for top). |
| **Junior Youth** (13 & under; includes LAE) | Riders 13 & under as of Jan 1; NCHA youth membership. May ride in Non-Pro classes if eligible. Horses in LAE by age. | Primarily prizes (buckles, trophies); minimal cash ($100–$500 local); small youth purses in majors. |
| **Senior Youth** (14–18; includes LAE) | Riders 14–18 as of Jan 1; NCHA youth membership. May ride in Non-Pro classes if eligible. Horses in LAE by age. | Prizes-focused + modest cash ($200–$1,000 local); shares in youth divisions at majors ($1,000–$10,000+ for top). |
