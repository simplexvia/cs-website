### The Horse We’re Talking About
- 7½-year-old gelding  
- Finished ranch versatility / ranch riding horse  
- Trained through the bridle  
- Normally ridden and shown in a correction bit  
→ When a horse of this caliber suddenly throws a head-shake, tail-wring, or mini-buck into the lope, it is almost never confusion. It is usually subtle pain, rider error that has crept in, or he has learned he can get away with a tiny protest.

### The Original Question
> “As a horseman, when putting a horse into a lope the horse initially has some attitude or not focused on the rider where it may shake its head or do a little buck. How should the horseman respond in those situations?”

### Core Answer – What to Do in the Moment

#### Immediate Response (first 2–3 strides)
- Stay calm and centered.  
- Real bucking → one-rein stop instantly.  
- Head-shake / tail-wring / mini-hump → ride forward positively into a bigger, forward lope for 6–8 strides with steady contact and driving seat/leg.  
- NEVER death-grip both reins on a correction bit to “set his head.”

#### Next 30–60 seconds
- Down to a balanced, round trot.  
- Re-ask immediately — same lead, same spot. Cleaner cue, softer body, precise outside leg.  
- Instant clean departure → soften to a draping rein and let him cruise. Huge reward.

#### If he repeats it
- Option 1 (fastest on most finished horses): rapid trot–lope–trot transitions or tight figure-8s until he begs to be good.  
- Option 2: one-rein disengage hindquarters → send straight back into the lope.

### Common Mistakes That Create the Problem  
(Especially common on finished ranch horses)

1. **Getting lazy with your body and leaning forward at the cue**  
   Even a 5–10° forward tip drives your seat onto the forehand exactly when he needs to lift his back. Feels unfair → he flips his head or hops to rebalance.  
   Fix: Sit tall, shoulders over hips, “grow taller” the instant you ask.

2. **Accepting the first stride of the lope hollow because “he’ll round up in two strides”**  
   A finished horse in a correction bit can and should leave round from the very first footfall. Accepting even one hollow stride teaches him a little protest is okay; over rides it becomes a head-shake or mini-buck.  
   Fix: Demand the first stride be as perfect as the last stride of a winning pattern. If it’s hollow → immediate down-transition and re-ask.

3. Holding two tight reins while asking  
4. Asking from a hollow, strung-out trot  
5. Always loping in the same corner (anticipation)  
6. Letting him lope off after any attitude  
7. Over-facing or drilling when fresh  
8. Constant nagging leg or dead hands  
9. Neglecting lateral suppleness  
10. Riding front-to-back instead of back-to-front  

### Everyday Mistakes That Keep It Alive
- Loping off on draped rein with no supporting leg → falls on forehand  
- Nagging constantly with the leg → dead-sided & resentful  
- Accepting even one poor departure  
- Correcting only with the bit instead of the feet  

### Training Plan (3–6 weeks for a finished ranch versatility horse)

#### Phase 0 – Rule Out Pain (48–72 hours – do this first)
- Vet flexions + hock/stifle imaging if needed  
- Chiropractor / bodywork  
- Re-check saddle fit at the lope  
- 14-day GastroGard trial if any history of cinchiness

#### Phase 1 – Re-Boot the Foundation (Week 1 – 4–5 rides)
- Warm up exactly like show day  
- 10–15 min perfect walk–trot–walk every 6–8 strides  
- Heavy lateral work at trot (leg-yield, shoulder-in, haunches-in, counter-arc)  
- No lope until every transition is instant and round

#### Phase 2 – Clean Lope off the Walk (Weeks 1–2)
- Lope departures only from a marching walk  
- Expect 100 % clean every ask  
- Any attitude → immediate Option 1 or 2, then re-ask within 30 sec  
- Goal: 15–20 perfect walk-to-lope each direction per ride

#### Phase 3 – Trot-to-Lope & Versatility Proofing (Weeks 2–4)
- Return to normal trot-to-lope work and patterns  
- Extended trot → lope, simple changes, rollbacks, speed transitions  
- Proof in new arenas and after cattle work

#### Phase 4 – Maintenance for the Ranch Versatility Horse
- Once a week lope off cold  
- Once a week big extended lope one lap → immediately ask for quiet, round departure  
- Lateral suppleness in every warm-up forever

### Golden Rules (Never Break)
1. A finished horse gets zero free passes  
2. Softness = immediate comfort and draping rein  
3. Attitude = immediate correction with the feet  
4. Consistency for 10–15 rides fixes even confirmed horses  
5. Ride back-to-front every single transition
