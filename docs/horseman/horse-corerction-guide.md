### The Horse We’re Talking About
- 7½-year-old gelding  
- Finished ranch versatility / ranch riding horse  
- Trained through the bridle  
- Normally ridden and shown in a correction bit  
→ This is a horse who already knows exactly how to leave perfectly round. Any attitude is almost always rider-induced or subtle pain.

### The Original Question
> “As a horseman, when putting a horse into a lope the horse initially has some attitude or not focused on the rider where it may shake its head or do a little buck. How should the horseman respond in those situations?”

### Core Answer – What to Do in the Moment

#### Immediate Response (first 2–3 strides)
- Stay calm and centered  
- Real buck → one-rein stop instantly  
- Head-shake / tail-wring / mini-hump → ride forward positively into a bigger lope for 6–8 strides  
- NEVER death-grip both reins on the correction bit

#### Next 30–60 seconds
- Down to a balanced, round trot  
- Re-ask immediately, same lead, same spot — cleaner cue, softer body  
- Instant clean departure → soften to draping rein, big reward

#### If he repeats it
- Option 1 (fastest): rapid trot–lope–trot or tight figure-8s until he begs to be good  
- Option 2: one-rein disengage hindquarters → send straight back into lope

### Common Mistakes That Create the Problem (with fixes)

| # | Mistake | Why it creates attitude | Immediate Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Leaning forward at the cue | Drives weight onto forehand → horse flips head or hops to rebalance | Sit tall, “grow taller” the instant you ask. Video yourself. |
| 2 | Accepting first stride hollow | Teaches protest is acceptable → becomes head-shake or mini-buck | If first stride isn’t round → down-transition and re-ask until perfect. Zero tolerance. |
| 3 | Holding two tight reins while asking | Traps shoulders → horse throws head up | Light inside rein, supportive outside rein. Cue with seat/legs first. |
| 4 | Asking from hollow trot | Already on forehand → only way to lope is to wrench neck | 50–100 perfect trot–walk–trot first. |
| 5 | Always same corner/spot | Anticipation → brace or protest | Randomize every departure for 30 days. |
| 6 | Letting him lope off after attitude | Rewards the behavior | Any attitude → correct with feet, then re-ask. Never continue. |
| 7 | Over-facing when fresh | Cold-backed horse gets sour | Walk/trot only first 10 min every ride. |
| 8 | Constant nagging leg | Desensitizes → explosion | One clear cue → immediate correction if ignored. |
| 9 | Neglecting lateral suppleness | Stiff ribcage can’t strike off soft | Every warm-up: leg-yield, shoulder-in, haunches-in, counter-arc. |
| 10 | Riding front-to-back | Pulls with bit → resentment | Inside leg to outside rein, push from hindquarters first. |

### Everyday Mistakes That Keep It Alive
- Loping off on draped rein with no supporting leg → fix: light inside leg until round  
- Nagging constantly with leg → fix: one crisp cue only  
- Accepting even one poor departure → fix: zero tolerance  
- Correcting only with the bit → fix: 90 % of corrections move the feet

### Training Plan (3–6 weeks for a finished horse)

#### Phase 0 – Rule Out Pain (48–72 hours)
Vet flexions, chiro, saddle fit at lope, GastroGard trial if needed.

#### Phase 1 – Re-Boot the Foundation (Week 1)
Show-day warm-up → perfect walk–trot transitions + heavy lateral work. No lope until everything is instant and round.

#### Phase 2 – Clean Lope off the Walk (Weeks 1–2)
Only walk-to-lope departures. 15–20 perfect each way per ride. Any attitude → immediate correction.

#### Phase 3 – Trot-to-Lope & Versatility Proofing (Weeks 2–4)
Return to full patterns, extended trot → lope, rollbacks, speed changes. Proof everywhere.

#### Phase 4 – Maintenance
- Once a week lope off cold  
- Once a week big extended lope → immediately ask quiet again  
- Lateral work in every warm-up forever

### Golden Rules (Never Break)
1. A finished horse gets zero free passes  
2. Softness = immediate comfort and draping rein  
3. Attitude = immediate correction with the feet  
4. Consistency for 10–15 rides fixes even confirmed horses  
5. Ride back-to-front every single transition
