### The Horse We’re Talking About
- 7½-year-old gelding  
- Finished ranch versatility / ranch riding horse  
- Trained through the bridle  
- Normally ridden/shown in a correction bit  
→ Attitude at the lope departure is almost always rider error or subtle pain.

### The Original Question
> “As a horseman, when putting a horse into a lope the horse initially has some attitude or not focused on the rider where it may shake its head or do a little buck. How should the horseman respond in those situations?”

### Core Answer – What to Do in the Moment

#### Immediate Response (first 2–3 strides)
- Stay calm and centered  
- Real buck → one-rein stop instantly  
- Head-shake / tail-wring / mini-hump → ride forward positively into a bigger lope for 6–8 strides  
- NEVER death-grip both reins on the correction bit

#### Next 30–60 seconds
- Down to balanced, round trot  
- Re-ask immediately — same lead, same spot — cleaner cue, softer body  
- Instant clean departure → soften to draping rein, big reward

#### If he repeats it
- **Option 1** (fastest): rapid trot–lope–trot or tight figure-8s until he begs to be good  
- **Option 2**: one-rein disengage hindquarters → send straight back into lope

### Common Mistakes That Create the Problem (with fixes)

| # | Mistake                                      | Why it creates attitude                              | Immediate Fix                                                                                  |
|---|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Leaning forward at the cue                   | Drives weight onto forehand                           | Sit tall, “grow taller” the instant you ask. Video yourself.                                   |
| 2 | Accepting first stride hollow                | Teaches protest is acceptable                         | If first stride isn’t round → down-transition and re-ask until perfect. Zero tolerance.       |
| 3 | Holding two tight reins while asking         | Traps shoulders                                       | Light inside rein, supportive outside rein. Cue with seat/legs first.                         |
| 4 | Asking from hollow trot                      | Already on forehand                                   | 50–100 perfect trot–walk–trot first.                                                           |
| 5 | Always same corner/spot                      | Anticipation                                          | Randomize every departure for 30 days.                                                         |
| 6 | Letting him lope off after any attitude      | Rewards the behavior                                 | Any attitude → correct with feet, then re-ask. Never continue.                                 |
| 7 | Over-facing when fresh                       | Cold-backed horse gets sour                           | Walk/trot only first 10 min every ride.                                                        |
| 8 | Constant nagging leg                         | Desensitizes → explosion                              | One clear cue → immediate correction if ignored.                                               |
| 9 | Neglecting lateral suppleness                | Stiff ribcage can’t strike off soft                   | Every warm-up: leg-yield, shoulder-in, haunches-in, counter-arc.                               |
|10| Riding front-to-back                         | Pulls with bit → resentment                           | See detailed section below.                                                                    |

### Everyday Mistakes That Keep It Alive
- Loping off on draped rein with no supporting leg → keep light inside leg until round  
- Nagging constantly with leg → one crisp cue only  
- Accepting even one poor departure → zero tolerance  
- Correcting only with the bit → 90 % of corrections must move the feet

### How to Push from the Hindquarters First (the real cure for #10)

**WRONG order (front-to-back)**  
Hands → voice → legs → hollow + attitude

**CORRECT order (back-to-front) – do this every single departure**  
1. Horse is already forward and round (engine running)  
2. Inside leg steady at girth → inside hind steps deeper under  
3. Outside leg 2–4 inches behind girth → one clear bump → outside hind under + bend  
4. Seat deepens slightly, inside seat bone a hair heavier → true “lope cue”  
5. Inside hand lifts ½–1 inch and softens forward (invites bend & lift)  
6. Outside rein stays steady and receiving – never pulls back  
7. One soft kiss only if needed – most departures silent on a finished horse

**One-sentence summary you can say out loud**  
“Inside hind, outside hind, sit, soften, go.”

**Quick drills (3–5 rides)**
- 50 walk-to-lope departures per ride with reins on the buckle  
- Trot–halt–trot until he rocks back on hocks  
- Leg-yield both directions until inside hind is active

### Golden Rules (Never Break)
1. Finished horse = zero free passes  
2. Softness = immediate comfort and draping rein  
3. Attitude = immediate correction with the feet  
4. Consistency for 10–15 rides fixes even confirmed horses  
5. Ride back-to-front every single transition
