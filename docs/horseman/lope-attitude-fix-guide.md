### The Horse We’re Talking About
- 7½-year-old gelding  
- Finished ranch versatility / ranch riding horse  
- Trained through the bridle  
- Normally ridden/shown in a correction bit  
→ Any head-shake, tail-wring, or mini-buck at the lope departure is almost always rider-induced or subtle pain.

### The Original Question
> “As a horseman, when putting a horse into a lope the horse initially has some attitude or not focused on the rider where it may shake its head or do a little buck. How should the horseman respond in those situations?”

### Core Answer – What to Do in the Moment

#### Immediate Response (first 2–3 strides)
- Stay calm and centered  
- Real buck → one-rein stop instantly  
- Head-shake / tail-wring / mini-hump → ride forward positively into a bigger lope for 6–8 strides  
- NEVER death-grip both reins on the correction bit

#### Next 30–60 seconds
- Down to balanced, round trot  
- Re-ask immediately — same lead, same spot — cleaner cue, softer body  
- Instant clean departure → soften to draping rein, big reward

#### If he repeats it
- **Option 1** (fastest): rapid trot–lope–trot or tight figure-8s until he begs to be good  
- **Option 2**: one-rein disengage hindquarters → send straight back into lope

### Common Mistakes That Create the Problem (full detail)

| # | Mistake                                          | Why it creates head-shaking / mini-bucks on a finished horse                                                                                  | Immediate Fix (do this every single time)                                                                                              |
|---|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Leaning forward or throwing your body at the cue | Even 5–10° forward tip drives seat onto forehand the exact moment he needs to lift his back → feels unfair → head flip or hop to rebalance      | Sit tall, shoulders over hips, think “grow taller” the instant you ask. Video yourself.                                               |
| 2 | Accepting the first stride hollow                | A finished horse can leave round from the very first footfall. Accepting even one hollow stride teaches “a little protest is okay” → he exaggerates it | If first stride isn’t as round as the last stride of a winning pattern → immediate down-transition and re-ask until perfect. Zero tolerance. |
| 3 | Holding two tight reins while asking             | Traps shoulders, blocks strike-off → horse throws head up or hops                                                                            | Light inside rein (just enough for bend), supportive but never locked outside rein. Cue with seat/legs first, hands last.               |
| 4 | Asking from a hollow or strung-out trot          | Horse already on forehand → only way to lope is to wrench neck or buck                                                                       | Never lope until trot is round, rhythmic, and pushing from behind. Do 50–100 perfect trot–walk–trot first.                             |
| 5 | Always loping in the same spot or corner        | Creates anticipation → he braces or protests before you even ask                                                                            | Randomize every departure for the next 30 days — middle of arena, diagonals, after leg-yield, etc.                                    |
| 6 | Letting him lope off after any attitude         | Instantly teaches “head-shake = I still get to go forward” → he repeats it                                                                    | Any attitude → immediate correction (hustle feet or disengage), then re-ask. Never let him continue loping after a protest.           |
| 7 | Over-facing or drilling when fresh               | Cold-backed or fresh horse gets sore/sour → expresses it at the lope departure                                                               | First 5–10 min of every ride: walk & easy trot only. Save lope work for when he’s mentally ready.                                      |
| 8 | Constant nagging leg or dead hands               | Desensitizes him → only a big kick gets a reaction → explosion                                                                              | One clear, crisp cue. If ignored → one sharp bump + immediate hustle of feet.                                                          |
| 9 | Neglecting lateral suppleness                    | Stiff ribcage/shoulders physically cannot strike off cleanly → he hops or twists                                                             | Every warm-up: leg-yield both ways, shoulder-in, haunches-in, counter-arc circles until loose sideways.                                |
|10| Riding front-to-back instead of back-to-front    | You pull him into the lope with the bit → resentment → head-shake or buck                                                                   | See full “Push from the Hindquarters First” section below.                                                                            |

### Everyday Mistakes That Keep It Alive
- Loping off on draped rein with no supporting leg → keep light inside leg until round  
- Nagging constantly with leg → one crisp cue only  
- Accepting even one poor departure → zero tolerance  
- Correcting only with the bit → 90 % of corrections must move the feet

### How to Push from the Hindquarters First (the real cure for #10)

**WRONG order (front-to-back)**  
Hands → voice → legs → hollow + attitude

**CORRECT order (back-to-front) – do this every single departure**  
1. Horse is already forward and round (engine running)  
2. Inside leg steady at girth → inside hind steps deeper under  
3. Outside leg 2–4 inches behind girth → one clear bump → outside hind under + bend  
4. Seat deepens slightly, inside seat bone a hair heavier → true “lope cue”  
5. Inside hand lifts ½–1 inch and softens forward (invites bend & lift)  
6. Outside rein stays steady and receiving – never pulls back  
7. One soft kiss only if needed – most departures silent on a finished horse

**One-sentence summary you can say out loud**  
“Inside hind, outside hind, sit, soften, go.”

**Quick drills (3–5 rides)**  
- 50 walk-to-lope departures per ride with reins on the buckle  
- Trot–halt–trot until he rocks back on hocks  
- Leg-yield both directions until inside hind is active

### Golden Rules (Never Break)
1. Finished horse = zero free passes  
2. Softness = immediate comfort and draping rein  
3. Attitude = immediate correction with the feet  
4. Consistency for 10–15 rides fixes even confirmed horses  
5. Ride back-to-front every single transition
