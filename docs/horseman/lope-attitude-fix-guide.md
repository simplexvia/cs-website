### The Horse We’re Talking About
- 7½-year-old gelding  
- Finished ranch versatility / ranch riding horse  
- Trained through the bridle  
- Normally ridden/shown in a correction bit  
→ Any head-shake, tail-wring, or mini-buck at the lope departure is almost always rider-induced or subtle pain.

### The Original Question
> “As a horseman, when putting a horse into a lope the horse initially has some attitude or not focused on the rider where it may shake its head or do a little buck. How should the horseman respond in those situations?”

### Core Answer  What to Do in the Moment

#### Immediate Response (first 2–3 strides)
- Stay calm and centered  
- Real buck → one-rein stop instantly  
- Head-shake / tail-wring / mini-hump → ride forward positively into a bigger lope for 6–8 strides  
- NEVER death-grip both reins on the correction bit

#### Next 30–60 seconds
- Down to balanced, round trot  
- Re-ask immediately — same lead, same spot — cleaner cue, softer body  
- Instant clean departure → soften to draping rein, big reward

#### If he repeats it
- **Option 1** (fastest): rapid trot–lope–trot or tight figure-8s until he begs to be good  
- **Option 2**: one-rein disengage hindquarters → send straight back into lope

### Common Mistakes That Create the Problem

| # | Mistake                                          | Why it creates head-shaking / mini-bucks on a finished horse                                                                                  | Immediate Fix (do this every single time)                                                                                              |
|---|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Leaning forward or throwing your body at the cue | Even 5–10° forward tip drives seat onto forehand the exact moment he needs to lift his back → feels unfair → head flip or hop to rebalance      | Sit tall, shoulders over hips, think “grow taller” the instant you ask. Video yourself.                                               |
| 2 | Accepting the first stride hollow                | A finished horse can leave round from the very first footfall. Accepting even one hollow stride teaches “a little protest is okay” → he exaggerates it | If first stride isn’t as round as the last stride of a winning pattern → immediate down-transition and re-ask until perfect. Zero tolerance. |
| 3 | Holding two tight reins while asking             | Traps shoulders, blocks strike-off → horse throws head up or hops                                                                            | Light inside rein (just enough for bend), supportive but never locked outside rein. Cue with seat/legs first, hands last.               |
| 4 | Asking from a hollow or strung-out trot          | Horse already on forehand → only way to lope is to wrench neck or buck                                                                       | Never lope until trot is round, rhythmic, and pushing from behind. Do 50–100 perfect trot–walk–trot first.                             |
| 5 | Always loping in the same spot or corner        | Creates anticipation → he braces or protests before you even ask                                                                            | Randomize every departure for the next 30 days — middle of arena, diagonals, after leg-yield, etc.                                    |
| 6 | Letting him lope off after any attitude         | Instantly teaches “head-shake = I still get to go forward” → he repeats it                                                                    | Any attitude → immediate correction (hustle feet or disengage), then re-ask. Never let him continue loping after a protest.           |
| 7 | Over-facing or drilling when fresh               | Cold-backed or fresh horse gets sore/sour → expresses it at the lope departure                                                               | First 5–10 min of every ride: walk & easy trot only. Save lope work for when he’s mentally ready.                                      |
| 8 | Constant nagging leg or dead hands               | Desensitizes him → only a big kick gets a reaction → explosion                                                                              | One clear, crisp cue. If ignored → one sharp bump + immediate hustle of feet.                                                          |
| 9 | Neglecting lateral suppleness                    | Stiff ribcage/shoulders physically cannot strike off cleanly → he hops or twists                                                             | Every warm-up: leg-yield both ways, shoulder-in, haunches-in, counter-arc circles until loose sideways.                                |
|10| Riding front-to-back instead of back-to-front    | You pull him into the lope with the bit → resentment → head-shake or buck                                                                   | See full “Push from the Hindquarters First” section below.                                                                            |

### Everyday Mistakes That Keep It Alive
- Loping off on draped rein with no supporting leg → keep light inside leg until round  
- Nagging constantly with leg → one crisp cue only  
- Accepting even one poor departure → zero tolerance  
- Correcting only with the bit → 90 % of corrections must move the feet

### How to Push from the Hindquarters First (the real cure for #10)

**WRONG order (front-to-back)**  
Hands → voice → legs → hollow + attitude

**CORRECT order (back-to-front) – do this every single departure**  
1. Horse is already forward and round (engine running)  
2. Inside leg steady at girth → inside hind steps deeper under  
3. Outside leg 2–4 inches behind girth → one clear bump → outside hind under + bend  
4. Seat deepens slightly, inside seat bone a hair heavier → true “lope cue”  
5. Inside hand lifts ½–1 inch and softens forward (invites bend & lift)  
6. Outside rein stays steady and receiving – never pulls back  
7. One soft kiss only if needed – most departures silent on a finished horse

**One-sentence summary you can say out loud**  
“Inside hind, outside hind, sit, soften, go.”

**Quick drills (3–5 rides)**  
- 50 walk-to-lope departures per ride with reins on the buckle  
- Trot–halt–trot until he rocks back on hocks  
- Leg-yield both directions until inside hind is active

### Lope Speed Cues – How to Speed Up or Slow Down Without Losing Roundness  
(Once the departure is fixed, most ranch versatility horses start rushing or getting lazy. Fix it the same way the top riders do.)

| Goal                  | Body cue (primary)                                    | Leg cue                                           | Rein cue (support only)                          | Common mistake to avoid                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Slow the lope**     | Sit deeper, exhale, slightly close both seat bones   | Close both calves very lightly (steady pressure) | Slight “checking” lift on both reins, then soften | Pulling steadily back → horse hollows or braces      |
| **Collect / shorten** | Sit taller, roll pelvis under, breathe into your belly | Inside leg at girth for lift, outside leg back for engagement | Tiny inside lift + outside direct rein if needed | Dropping inside shoulder or tipping forward         |
| **Extend the lope**   | Lighten seat, breathe in, tip pelvis slightly forward | Both legs 2–3 inches farther back, soft bump-bump  | Open both hands forward 1–2 inches, then steady  | Kicking hard or leaning forward (causes hollow)     |
| **Big fast → slow**   | After one extended lap: sit deep, exhale, close calves | Light steady calf pressure                        | One soft half-halt, then immediately soften      | Yanking or getting stiff → horse throws head        |
| **Emergency slow**    | Freeze seat, big exhale, sit like a rock              | Both legs clamped lightly on (no kicking)         | One firm half-halt on outside rein → instant soften | Two-rein death grip → horse inverts and bucks        |

**Key principles for a finished ranch horse**  
- 90 % of speed control comes from your seat and legs, not the bit.  
- The correction bit is only there to shape and support, never to pull speed down.  
- Always reward the correct response with an immediate softening of seat, legs, and reins.  
- Practice 10–20 speed transitions per ride (slow → extend → slow) once the departure is 100 % clean.

Do these speed cues exactly like the top NRCHA and AQHA ranch riding winners and your gelding will stay round, adjustable, and happy from a jog to an extended lope and back again—no more head-shaking from being yanked on or kicked hard.

### Golden Rules (Never Break)
1. Finished horse = zero free passes  
2. Softness = immediate comfort and draping rein  
3. Attitude = immediate correction with the feet  
4. Consistency for 10–15 rides fixes even confirmed horses  
5. Ride back-to-front every single transition
