# 3–6 Week Training Plan  
**Fixing Lope-Departure Attitude on a Finished Ranch Versatility Gelding**  
(7½ years old, correction bit, trained through the bridle)

## Phase 0 – Rule Out Pain (48–72 hours – do this first)
- Vet flexions + hock/stifle imaging if any suspicion  
- Chiropractor / bodyworker  
- Professional saddle fit check while loping  
- 14-day GastroGard trial if any history of cinchiness or sourness

## Phase 1 – Re-Boot the Foundation (Week 1 – 4–5 rides)
Goal: Every walk & trot transition instant, round, and soft before any lope work.  
Daily (30–45 min):
1. Show-day warm-up routine  
2. 10–15 min perfect walk–trot–walk every 6–8 strides  
3. Heavy lateral work: leg-yield both ways, shoulder-in, haunches-in, counter-arc circles  
4. NO lope until everything is butter-soft

## Phase 2 – Clean Lope off the Walk (Weeks 1–2)
Start as soon as Phase 1 is flawless.
- Lope departures ONLY from a marching walk  
- 15–20 perfect departures each direction per ride  
- 100 % clean expected every ask  
- Any attitude → immediate hustle feet or disengage hindquarters, then re-ask within 30 sec

## Phase 3 – Trot-to-Lope & Versatility Proofing (Weeks 2–4)
- Return to normal trot-to-lope work  
- Extended trot → lope, simple changes, rollbacks, speed transitions  
- Proof in new arenas, on the ranch, after cattle work  
- Zero-tolerance for any attitude

## Phase 4 – Maintenance (ongoing)
- Once a week: lope off cold (first thing out of stall/pasture)  
- Once a week: big extended lope one lap → immediately ask quiet, round departure  
- Lateral suppleness work in every warm-up forever  
- Any relapse → drop straight back to Phase 1 work for 5–10 minutes

Follow exactly for 2–4 weeks and the head-shaking/mini-buck disappears and stays gone as long as you never get lazy again.
